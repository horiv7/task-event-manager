# Angular Assigment - EventManager

![Tasks](./assigment.jpg)

## Notes

- Completed tasks are separated by **commits** and **#number** for each task(excluding 1 and 4 which I forgot to mark with number).  

- The starting code is marked as a _first commit_.

- It tried to stay in the same style as in the delivered code. Although some things are structured in a different way than the style recommended by Angular.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
